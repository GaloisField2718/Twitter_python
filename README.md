# Twitter python

## 🎯 Goal

### 1. 🙌 Give the code which is running on Twitter

I created two twitter account : [@Marketcryptopy](https://twitter.com/marketcryptopy) and [@dogeaccountpy](https://twitter.com/dogeaccountpy) which is running since few month and I want to share this code. 

It's not strong coded and we can improve it in several differents ways but for now it works and that's cool 😎.

I will briefly details after what I used to get cryptocurrencies prices 🤑, what config we need to use with tweepy and basic tweepy commands.

### 2. 🐚 Give some advice to use Twitter on python3 command-line

I also want to provide the basic shell commands I use to interact with *@Marketcryptopy* on my console. 
I'm trying to use *MarketCryptoPy* only in command line and never interact through Twitter interface. Sometimes it's harder but it's fun to see it's possible.



## 🔩 Tools

### 1. 💰 Get prices

To get prices I use 2 differents API :

👉 *MarketCryptoPy* : **python-binance**.
 
The unofficial documentation : [python-binance](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but it's quite hard to onboard through this. There is an incredible Youtube Channel [@cryptorobotfr](https://www.youtube.com/@cryptorobotfr), they are french but you can translate the video and their code is in english so don't worry 😁.

One very good video to beginning with python-binance package [[TUTO FR] Créer son PROPRE BOT DE TRADING CRYPTO facilement en Python !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gNIWHh539A&t=1221s) and the associated github repo [create personnal trading bot](https://github.com/CryptoRobotFr/1-create-personnal-trading-bot)


👉 *DogeAccountPy* : **CoinMarketCap-API**.









## Structure

It is a basic repository with just some python code
